## üöÄ Quick Start

> Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docker-hosting-platform.git
cd docker-hosting-platform

2. docker-compose up --build

3.  Local Development - /etc/hosts Setup

To access your local website using a custom domain like my-site.localhost, 
add the following entry to your /etc/hosts file:
127.0.0.1   my-site.local

Note: On Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS), you will need root privileges to edit this file:
sudo nano /etc/hosts
After editing, you can access your site at http://my-site.local in your browser.

4. üîê FTP Setup

FTP Port: 21
Passive Ports: 30000-30009
Authentication: via MySQL (pureftpd database)
You can use FileZilla or any other FTP client to connect.

Add your local public IP address to the /etc/hosts file for FTP access (e.g., ftp.local):
<Your_Public_IP>   ftp.local
You can find your public IP by searching "What is my IP" in a search engine. 
After adding this, FTP can be accessed via ftp.local.

5. Register Your Domain
Once the services are running, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1. You will be prompted to register your domain details, including:
Domain name
Email
FTP username and password (generated automatically)
Database credentials

6. FTP Access via FileZilla
You can use an FTP client like FileZilla to connect to ftp.local using the FTP credentials provided on the page. Just input the following:
Server: ftp.local
Username: The FTP username you registered
Password: The FTP password you registered
Port: 21 (default FTP port)
